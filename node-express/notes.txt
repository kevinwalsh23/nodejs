Rest: Representational State Transfer

Web Services:
-system designed to support interoperability of systems connected over a network
-service oriented arcirtecture (SOA)
-standardized way of integrating web based apps using open standards operating over the internet

Two common approaches:
SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol
-uses WSDL (Web Services Description Lang)
-XML based

REST
-use web standards
-exchange of data using XML or JSON
-simpler compared to SOAP, WDSL etc

Server supports rest api, client can invoke api endpoint

REST
style of software architecture for distrubited hypermedia such as WWW
introducted in dissertation
collection of network architecture principles outline how resources are defined and addressed
Four basic principles:
-use http methods explicitely
-be stateless
-expose directory structure like URIs
-transfer using XML, JSON, or both

Motivation for REST was to capture characteristics of Web that made web successful
-URI UNiform Resource Indicator Addressable resources
-HTTP Protocol
-Make request, receive response, display response
 Expoits use of HTTP protocol beyond POST AND GET 
-HTTP PUT, DELETE
-preserve idempotence

Nouns > resources
Verbs > actions
Representations > XML, JSON

Resources:
key abstraction of information REST is resources (specified by URL)
resource is conceptual mapping to a set of entities
directory structure

Verbs: actions to be performed on resources
GET > READ
POST > CREATE
PUT > UPDATE
DELETE > DELETE

Express Router
Express Application Routes
-identify endpoint with a URI
-apply the verb on the URI
-Express supports this through app.all, app.get, app.post, app.put, app.delete methods
Application Routes:
-app.all('dishes', function(req, res, next){})
-specifies what needs to be done on these type of requests
Routes with Parameters
-Example: app.get('dishes.:dishId', (req, res, next) => {
    res.end('Will send details of your dish:' + req.params.dishId+ 'to you!')
})

-use req.params.{param_you_choose}

Body Parser
-data enclosed in body of message
-need to exttract info from body of message
-middleware to parse body of message
Using Body Parser:
var bodyParser = require(body-parser)
app.use(bodyParser.json()); //parse the Json in the body
Parses the body of the message and populates the req.body property

Multiple Endpoints
-subdivied into multiple modules
Express Router creates mini Express Application
var dishRouter = express.Router();
dishRouter.use(bodyParser.json());

dishRouter.route('/')
    .all(...);
    .get(...);

Exercise: Express Router
npm install body-parser@1.18.3 --save
index.js > const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
appuse(bodyParnser.json)
//use app.use when wanting to include middleware

build /dishes endpoint
app.all('/dishes', (req, res, next) => {
    //handle incoming requests
    //all means no matter what method, this code executed first
    res.statusCode = 200;
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain')
    next();
    //next means it continues on looking for additional specs matching endpoint
})

app.get('/dishes, (req, res, next) => {
    res.end('Will send dishes to you')
});

app.post(/dishes, (req, res, next) => {
    res.end('Will send dishes to you' + req.body.name + req.body.description)
});

app.put(/dishes, (req, res, next) => {
    res.statusCode = 403; //operation not supported
    res.end('Put operation not supported on /dishes endpoint');
});

app.delete('/dishes, (req, res, next) => {
    res.end('Deleting all the dishes to you')
});

app.get('/dishes/:dishId, (req, res, next) => {
    res.end('Will send details of the dish: ' + req.params.dishId)
});

app.post(/dishes/:dishId, (req, res, next) => {
    res.statusCode = 403; //operation not supported
    res.end('Put operation not supported on /dishes endpoint');
});

app.put(/dishes/:dishId, (req, res, next) => {
    res.write('Updating the dish: ' + req.params.dishId)
    res.end('Will update the dish '+ req.params.dishId);
});

app.delete('/dishes/:dishId, (req, res, next) => {
    res.end('Deleting the dish '+ req.params.dishId + 'for you.')
});

Can subdivide into mini express apps, and can use express router to constuct mini express app
in express router, we support api for one group (like above)

Create new folder, and new file called dishRouter.js
handles rest api endpoint for /dishes and /dishes/:dishId

const express = require('express');
still require express in dishRouter file, once you define new file it becomes its own module
const bodyParser = require(body-parser);

const dishRouter = express.Router();
//declares dishRouter as express router

//takes endpoint as params
//declaring endpoint as one single location where you can chain all methods
//becomes one group of method implementations
dishRouter.route('/');
need to mount within index.js file
mount at /dishes endpoint

module.exports = dishRouter;

const dishRouter = require('./routes/dishRouter')

app.use('.dishes', dishRouter)

app.all('/dishes', (req,res,next) => {
    res.statusCode = 200;
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
    next();
  });
  
  app.get('/dishes', (req,res,next) => {
      res.end('Will send all the dishes to you!');
  });
  
  app.post('/dishes', (req, res, next) => {
   res.end('Will add the dish: ' + req.body.name + ' with details: ' + req.body.description);
  });
  
  app.put('/dishes', (req, res, next) => {
    res.statusCode = 403;
    res.end('PUT operation not supported on /dishes');
  });
   
  app.delete('/dishes', (req, res, next) => {
      res.end('Deleting all dishes');
  });
  
  app.get('/dishes/:dishId', (req,res,next) => {
      res.end('Will send details of the dish: ' + req.params.dishId +' to you!');
  });
  
  app.post('/dishes/:dishId', (req, res, next) => {
    res.statusCode = 403;
    res.end('POST operation not supported on /dishes/'+ req.params.dishId);
  });
  
  app.put('/dishes/:dishId', (req, res, next) => {
    res.write('Updating the dish: ' + req.params.dishId + '\n');
    res.end('Will update the dish: ' + req.body.name + 
          ' with details: ' + req.body.description);
  });
  
  app.delete('/dishes/:dishId', (req, res, next) => {
      res.end('Deleting dish: ' + req.params.dishId);
  });

Intro to MongoDB
SQL: structured query language, relational database
NoSQL Databases
1. Document databases (Mongo)
2. Key Value (redis)
3. Column-family databases (Cassandra)
4. Graph databases (Neo4J)

Document Databases
-Document: self contained piece of info
-e.g. JSON
Collection: collection of documents
Database: set of collections

Why NoSQL
1. Scalability
-availability
-consistency
-partition tolerance
2. Ease of Deployment
-no object relation mapping required

MongoDB
Document Database
-Server can support multiple databases
-database is set of collections
-collection is set of documents
-Document is effectively a JSON doc with additional features
Mongo stores docs in BSON (Binary JSON) format
-Supports length prefix on each value (easy to skip over a field)
-Info about the type of field value
-Additional primitives types not supported by raw json like UTC date time, raw binary, and ObjectId

MongoDB ObjectId
Every document in Mongo must have an "_id" field that is unique
Default ObjectId created by Mongo when you insert a document
OnjectId is 12 byte field: Timestamp (4), Machine ID (3), Proc ID (2), Increment (3)
id.getTimestamp returns timestamp in ISO Date format

Mongo Troubleshooting
How do I ensure that Mongo binaries are in my PATH - in my shell' rc (~/.bashrc) on a Mac
sudo cp mongodb-osx-x86_64-2.6.7/bin/* /usr/local/bin/

Mongod complains that there is no /data/db folder
sudo chown -R $USER /data/db (at home terminal)

unable to start mongodb local server
Use sudo killall -15 mongod instead

Node and MongoDB
How to access Mongo with Node app
NodeJS driver officially avail from Mongo devs

Node MongoDB driver
provides high level API to interact with Mongo server
Installation: npm install mongodb --save

Node mongoDB river support several operations tyhat can be performed:
-connect to mongodb
-insert, delete, update, query records
Supports callback and promise based interactions

Create index.js (app that interacts with Mongodb server)

const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;
const assert = require('assert');

const url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/';
//port where mongo server is running
const dbname = 'conFusion';

MongoClientconnect(url, (err, client) => {
    assert.equal(err, null);

    console.log('Connected to Server');

    const db = client.db(dbname);
    //connect to database

    const collection = db.collection('dishes');

    collection.insertOne({ "name": "Thing", "description": "fun database stuff!"}, (err, result) => {
        assert.equal(err, null);
        console.log("After Insert:\n")
        console.log(result.ops)
        collection.find({}).toArray((err, docs) => {
            assert.equal(err, null);
            console.log(docs);
            
        })
    })

});
